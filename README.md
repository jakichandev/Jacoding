### My personal Portfolio!

This is my Portfolio based on Vite, Typescript, React, React-Router and Tailwind.
The entry point is in "src/main.tsx"

## Style

You can discover theme variables in "src/App.css" where you find @theme directive that it contains all default values.

## Start the project

You can test my project writing on the terminal:
```yarn dev```
