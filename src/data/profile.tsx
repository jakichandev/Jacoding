  aboutMe: `After five years as a video technician in a service
dedicated to events and conferences, I decided to try to create
an opportunity for myself to become a frontend developer. Why
frontend? It's not that I dislike backend, but I feel that frontend
is more my field, since I studied graphic design in high school
and I feel more inclined to develop the experience
and appearance of a web application (even though I know that the world
of frontend goes far beyond the concept of graphics and web design).
Through self-study, I have learned how to
develop web applications with React or NextJs, styled
components, and how to manage their local and global status.
Furthermore, by studying NodeJS, I am able to create a backend with
Express, creating CRUD applications and authentication with
JWT, integrating communication with databases such as
MongoDB or mySQL. I am eager to test myself
in this world and eager to learn new technologies.
My future goal? To develop in Flutter and have full
mastery of AI integration in applications.`,
